# Player Commands
> The following commands are available to [all players, OPs, and console by default](./GitHub/Rankup3/plugin/Player.html).  
> Rankup3's commands are available after the plugin is [enabled](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/EnableRankupPlugin.html) by your server.  
> Only run commands after the server has finished starting up.

Checks a player has met the `requirements:` then moves a player up the rankup ladder. | [Implementation](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/commands/RankupCommand.html)
`/ranks`        | `rankup.ranks`     | [`ranks:`](./GitHub/Rankup3/config/Ranks.html)          | Displays the entire rankup ladder relative to the player's current step. | [Implementation](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/commands/RanksCommand.html)
`/maxrankup`    | `rankup.maxrankup` | [`max-rankup:`](./GitHub/Rankup3/config/MaxRankup.html) | Will rankup the player as many times as possible and without displaying confirmation windows until they fail to meet the `next` rankup step's requirements or complete the ladder. | [Implementation](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/commands/MaxRankupCommand.html)
`/prestige`     | `rankup.prestige`  | [`prestige:`](./GitHub/Rankup3/config/Prestige.html)    | The secondary progression command. Checks a player has met the `requirements:` then moves a player up the prestige ladder. | [Implementation](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/commands/PrestigeCommand.html)
`/prestiges`    | `rankup.prestiges` | [`prestiges:`](./GitHub/Rankup3/config/Prestiges.html)  | Displays the entire prestiges ladder relative to the player's current step. | [Implementation](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/commands/PrestigesCommand.html)

# Admin Commands

> The following commands are only available to [OPs and console by default](./GitHub/Rankup3/plugin/Admin.html).  
> If OPs are disabled, a player with `rankup.admin` can access the same commands as an OP.  
> Specifically, `rankup.admin` grants [`rankup.checkversion`, `rankup.reload`, `rankup.force`, and `rankup.notify`](./GitHub/Rankup3/plugin/Admin.html).  
> The plugin used to be called PrisonRankup, which is why [`/pru` is still an alias for `/rankup3`](./GitHub/Rankup3/plugin/PRU.html).  
> Therefore, any `/rankup3` command can substitute `rankup3` for `pru`, like `/pru reload`.

# Debug Commands
> The following commands are also only available to [OPs and console by default](./GitHub/Rankup3/plugin/Admin.html).  
> However, unlike the prior [Admin Commands](#admin-commands) these were introduced in version 3.9 and are not presented by autofill, so must be called explicitly.* (unconfirmed)

Useful for verifying the integrity of your file when only messages are throwing errors. | [Implementation](./GitHub/Rankup3/Java/commands/InfoCommand/tree.html)
