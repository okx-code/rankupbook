# Minimum Requirements to use Rankup:
* Vault
* Vault-Compatible Group Management Plugin
  * **[LuckPerms](../Spigot/LuckPerms.html)** is strongly recommended and will be used throughout the following examples to manage groups.
* Pre-defined Permission Groups in prior Plugin for each rank/prestige.
## Installation
Place the jar file in the plugins folder and start or restart the server. The first time you start your server **with the Rankup jar file** the default **[rankups.yml](../GitHub/Rankup3/rankups.html)**, **[config.yml](../GitHub/Rankup3/config.html)**, and **[locale](../GitHub/Rankup3/locale.html)** will generate like **[this](../GitHub/Rankup3/resources.html)**. Stop your server once the plugins have loaded. The **[rankups.yml](../GitHub/Rankup3/rankups.html)** file is where you will add your ranks to. It's recommended to read through all the comments before making changes.
## Verify `config.yml` contains [`permission-rankup: false`](../GitHub/Rankup3/config/Permission-Rankup.html) (default)
## [`permission-rankup: true`](../GitHub/Rankup3/config/Permission-Rankup.html) is not covered in the tutorial. See the [Advanced Configuration](../Advanced-Configuration/Permission-Rankup.md#what-is-it) to learn more about Manual Mode.
